## Mock API 

### Extracting and manipulating data from a local JSON file
For a proposed project I required swell data from MagicSeaweed via their API. However, this is now closed to new applications and in lieu MSW provided 4 JSON files with swell data of 4 major surf spots in Cornwall, Hawaii, Gold Coast and California. 

This is a testing area which enabled me to extract data from the local JSON files and manipulate the data.
